# C2-Server

Welcome to **C2-Server** â€“ a web application developed using PHP that allows hackers to control their malicious software and analyze its performance, all in one place. This project is part of my 100-day challenge, and today is **Day 7/100**. I'm excited to share my progress with you!

## About C2-Server

C2-Server is designed to provide a comprehensive interface for managing and monitoring malicious software. The panel offers various features for controlling malware and analyzing its activity.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **PHP**: For server-side scripting and backend logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: For enhancing interactivity and functionality on the client side.
- **MySQL**: For database management and storage.

## Setup

To set up and run the C2-Server, follow these steps:

1. **Download the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scriptsorcery4/C2-Server-Day7-100-.git
    cd C2-Server-Day7-100-
    ```

2. **Configure the application**:

    - Open `config.php` and set your database connection details and other configurations.

3. **Set up the database**:

    - Import the SQL file provided in the repository to set up the necessary database tables.
    - You can do this using a tool like phpMyAdmin or via the command line.

    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p your_database < database.sql
    ```

4. **Run the application**:

    - Deploy the application on a local or remote web server that supports PHP and MySQL.
    - Open the application in your web browser.
